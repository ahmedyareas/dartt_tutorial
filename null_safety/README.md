# How To Use Nullable Variables
## You can use nullable variables in many ways. Some of them are shown below:

1. You can use if statement to check whether the variable is null or not.<br>
2. You can use ! operator, which returns null if the variable is null.<br>
3. You can use ?? operator to assign a default value if the variable is null.
